  abstract = {This study addresses the need to provide comprehensive historical climate data and climate change projections at a scale suitable for, and readily accessible to, researchers and resource managers. This database for western North America (WNA) includes over 20 000 surfaces of monthly, seasonal, and annual climate variables from 1901 to 2009; several climate normal periods; and multimodel climate projections for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s. A software package, ClimateWNA, allows users to access the database and query point locations, obtain time series, or generate custom climate surfaces at any resolution. The software uses partial derivative functions of temperature change along elevation gradients to improve medium-resolution baseline climate estimates and calculates biologically relevant climate variables such as growing degree-days, number of frost-free days, extreme temperatures, and dryness indices. Historical and projected future climates are obtained by using monthly temperature and precipitation anomalies to adjust the interpolated baseline data for the location of interest. All algorithms used in the software package are described and evaluated against observations from weather stations across WNA. The downscaling algorithms substantially improve the accuracy of temperature variables over the medium-resolution baseline climate surfaces. Climate variables that are usually calculated from daily data are estimated from monthly climate variables with high statistical accuracy.},

Sections on the application of rehabilitation techniques cover such topics as fish access and spawning sites, stream banks, off-channel habitat, using large woody debris, log-jam habitats, juvenile salmonid habitat, mainstem holding and rearing habitat, nutrient replacement, habitats in channelized or uniform streams, augmenting streamflows, and managing beaver habitat for salmonids.

Coho salmon were predominant at {"}natural' river sites while steelhead trout was the main species at sites with {"}rip-rap' bank stabilization. Catches of juvenile coho were much much lower in the main river than in the ponds where they were the main species, and were more variable in the river. Population density and biomass estimates of juvenile coho in the ponds ranged from 0.100 fish.m-2 and 1.00 g.m-2 to 1.00 fish.m-2 and 5.15 g.m-2, compared with density estimates of 0.08-0.23 fish.m-2 in the river. The coho population in the ponds consisted of 0+ and 1+ age-groups in similar proportions; in the main river the 0+ age-group was much more abundant. Growth rate of coho in the ponds was faster than in the main river, with pond fish reaching mean lengths of 62-79 mm at the end of the 1st growing season, compared with 53 mm in the main river. Smolt outmigration from the main study pond occurred in late spring with peak outmigration in May and June coinciding with peak river discharge and increasing water temperatures in the main river and pond. -from Authors},

  abstract = {On the basis of the Manning equation and basic mass conservation principles, we derive an expression for scaling the steady-state width (W) of river channels as a function of discharge (Q), channel slope (S), roughness (n), and width-to-depth ratio (α): W = [α(α + 2)2/3]3/8Q3/8S−3/16n3/8. We propose that channel width-to-depth ratio, in addition to roughness, is a function of the material in which the channel is developed, and that where a river is confined to a given material, width-to-depth ratio and roughness can be assumed constant. Given these simplifications, the expression emulates traditional width-discharge relationships for rivers incising bedrock with uniformly concave fluvial long profiles. More significantly, this relationship describes river width trends in terrain with spatially nonuniform rock uplift rates, where conventional discharge-based width scaling laws are inadequate. We suggest that much of observed channel width variability in river channels confined by bedrock is a simple consequence of the tendency for water to flow faster in steeper reaches and therefore occupy smaller channel cross sections. We demonstrate that using conventional scaling relationships for channel width can result in underestimation of stream-power variability in channels incising bedrock and that our model improves estimates of spatial patterns of bedrock incision rates.},
